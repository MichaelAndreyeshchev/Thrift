********************************************
SPRING 2024: 5105 Thrift Example:
Instructor: Anand Tripathi
*******************************************
In all these examples, the file multipilicatiin.thrift defines three interface methods:
  ping, helo, and multiply  
  hello is defined with "oneway" modifier, i.e. the client does not wait for the response. 


SimpleServer:
  The server is implemented as single threaded.
  The transport protocol used is TFramedTransport

ThreadPoolServer
  The server uses a thread pool for servicing requests.
  only two lines are changed in the Server.java  code of SimpleServer.

SimpleServer-without-FramedTransport 
  This service does NOT use framed transport.
  This code is very similar to the code give at
     https://thrift-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage-example.html

HOW TO RUN THESE EXAMPLES:

1. Go to the specific  example directory
2. Study the "thrift" intrface file.
3. Study the "Handler" code in Java, for example MultiplicationHandler.java
4. Study the code of Server.java and Client.java
5. Start clean by executing "clean.sh"
6. Execute "make.sh"
7. Now execute the Server using the following command,
   but before doign tht make sure that no previously created Server process is running.
   Kill that process if running.
   java -cp ".:./Thrift13/*" Server&
8. Now run the Client program by using the following command

   If your client is on the same machien as the server, execute the following command
      java -cp ".:./Thrift13/*" Client

   Otherwise
      java -cp ".:./Thrift13/*" Client serverHostName
